\usage{
SiteFrequencies(n, lambda, i = NULL, nSegSites = FALSE,
  tailStat = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the sample size (>=3)}

\item{lambda}{the nonnegative mutation rate}

\item{i}{either the number of the site frequency that should be considered
or the number of the first term of the tail statistic. In both cases \eqn{1 <= i <= n-1}.}

\item{nSegSites}{a logical value indicating whether the function should compute
the distribution of the number of segregating sites \eqn{(S_{Total} = \xi_1 + ... + \xi_{n-1})}.
If TRUE, any value of \eqn{i} will be ignored. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{tailStat}{a logical value indicating whether the function should compute
the distribution of the tail statistic \eqn{( S_{i+} = \xi_i +...+ \xi_{n-1})}.
If TRUE, \eqn{i} will determine the first term of this statistic. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
If \code{nSegSites = FALSE} and \code{tailStat= FALSE}, the function
returns the distribution of the \eqn{i}'th site frequency \eqn{(\xi_i)} plus one. If \code{nSegSites = TRUE},
the function returns the distribution of the total number of segregating sites plus one, and if
\code{tailStat= TRUE}, the distribution of the tail statistic (which first term
is determined by \eqn{i}) plus one is returned.
In all three cases, the returned object is of type \code{discphasetype}.

\description{
Finding the distribution of the site frequencies, the number of
segregating sites and the tail statistics using phase-type distributions.
}
\details{
This function can be used to compute the distribution of the site frequencies
\eqn{\xi_i + 1}, for all \eqn{i} in eqn{{1,...,n-1}}, the total number of segregating sites \eqn{S_{Total} + 1}
and the tail statistic \eqn{S_{i+} + 1}.
The reason for adding one to the site frequency is that the support for
discrete phase-type distributions is on the natural numbers excluding zero.
Hence, immediate absorbtion would not be possible. By adding one, we allow
the site frequency to be zero.
Note that the package does also include the function \code{\link{dSegregatingSites}},
which computes the density function of the number of segregating sites
for a given sample size \eqn{n}, a mutation parameter \eqn{\theta} and
a nonnegative vector of quantiles \eqn{k}.
